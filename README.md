## Project Overview
The **Movie-Review-Predictor** is a sophisticated machine learning application designed to analyze and predict the sentiment of movie reviews using the Bag of Words (BoW) model. This project features a comprehensive backend service built with Flask, providing real-time sentiment analysis capabilities. The BoW model processes the text by converting it into numerical representations based on word frequency, allowing the machine learning algorithm to classify the sentiments effectively. The repository includes the trained model, necessary scripts, and a frontend interface for user interaction. This project is ideal for integration into movie review platforms, offering valuable insights into user opinions and enhancing overall user engagement.
