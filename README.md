## Project Overview
The **Employee Management System** is a comprehensive web application designed to manage various employee-related activities within an organization. Developed during a 15-day summer internship at BrainyBeam Technologies Pvt Ltd, this project aims to streamline processes such as attendance management, salary management, and project tracking. The front-end of the application was crafted using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive user interface. The back-end leverages PHP and MySQL to handle data storage and server-side logic, ensuring robust performance and data integrity. This system enables administrators to efficiently manage employee information, assign projects, and monitor progress, thereby enhancing organizational productivity and operational efficiency.
